# What is Tidy Tuesday?

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in the R programming language community, created by R for Data Science authors Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick. The project involves posting a new dataset on the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repository every Tuesday, along with a set of questions or challenges related to the data. The aim of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a fun and collaborative way for R users to improve their data analysis and visualization skills, and to share their work with the broader community.

# What data I decided to use for one of the Tidy Tuesday?

In a Tidy Tuesday project, the Alone data set was provided, which contains information about the participants and their progress in the Alone TV series. The data set includes 8 seasons of the show, with each season consisting of a different set of contestants who are dropped off in a remote wilderness location and must survive alone. The data set includes information such as the contestant's name, age, gender, occupation, location, survival equipment, and duration of their stay.  The project provided a valuable opportunity for me to practice their data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills using real-world data in a fun and engaging way.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# I want to know the avg days survived between gender, then with age. 
library(tidyverse)
survivalists <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-01-24/survivalists.csv')

```

# On Average Days Lasted

39 days is the average days lasted on the show alone 
```{r}


#survivalists%>% 
#summarise(num_patients = n(),)

#table(survivalists$gender)
#table(survivalists$age)
agegen<- lm(days_lasted~gender ,survivalists)
#summary(agegen)

alone<- survivalists%>%
  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender =="Female",1,0))

gen_avg<-survivalists%>%
  select(gender, days_lasted)%>%
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarise(med_last = median(days_lasted))
  
#gen_avg

  ggplot(gen_avg,aes(gender,med_last,fill=gender))+
