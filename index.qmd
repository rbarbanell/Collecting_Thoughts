## Projects

**High-Performance Computing Bootcamp | Sustainable Horizons Institute | Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | August 2023**

**Summary: ** 

ntro to High-Performance Computing boot-camp was held in person at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It was hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) Computing Facilities at Argonne National Lab (ALCF), Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (NERSC), and Oak Ridge National Lab (OLCF) and organized by Sustainable Horizons Institute.

During my Intro to HPC boot camp, I gained insights into the critical issue of energy consumption within HPC systems. I discovered that inefficient code can lead to excessive energy usage, causing adverse environmental impacts and imposing significant financial burdens. Moreover, I learned that HPC systems have a distinctive characteristic of their substantial power requirements, relying heavily on electrical and cooling infrastructure. It became evident that these vital resources are not uniformly distributed worldwide, often leading to accessibility challenges in certain regions.

One of the key takeaways from the boot camp was the importance of optimizing code for efficiency, a practice that can significantly reduce energy consumption in large-scale computing systems. I also gained an understanding of how these efficiency principles can extend to other aspects of power infrastructure, further reinforcing my commitment to promoting energy justice and environmental sustainability in computing.

**Skills:**


- Used jupyter notebook and IRIS API tokens to log into Permitter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory to conduct analysis of large data sets.
- Hands on experience on python code to make data driven choices by analyzing energy consumption of different
super computers around the world.
- Learned about power infrastructure and reinforced my commitment to promoting energy justice and environmental sustainability in computing.
