Becca Barbanell's background as a visual artist, her extensive travels, and her previous career as a polarity therapy practitioner have all contributed to her holistic perspective on data science. Her ability to see the bigger picture, think creatively, and appreciate diverse viewpoints makes her a well-rounded and innovative data scientist.

When not investigating and implementing innovative data structures, Becca enjoys spending time with her dog, Theta Squared, and her partner, exploring nature, preparing food, having fun, and playing music.
