    "text": "Once upon a time, in a deep forest, there was a powerful and cunning wolf. His name was John the Wolf and was unlike any other, for he was able to transform into a human at will.\nOne day, as he was wandering through the woods, John the Wolf stumbled upon a group of humans. Intrigued by their ways, he decided to observe them from afar. The humans were busy with their daily activities, and among them, there was a group of people who caught the wolf’s attention. They were working with numbers, graphs, and statistics. The wolf had never seen anything like it before.\nCurious, John the Wolf approached the humans and asked them what they were doing. They explained that they were data scientists, and they were using data to solve problems and make informed decisions.\nThe John the Wolf was fascinated. He decided that he wanted to become a data scientist too. And so, he began to study. He spent hours poring over books and practicing his skills. He learned how to collect and analyze data, how to create algorithms and models, and how to use visualizations to communicate his findings.\nAs he grew more proficient, John the Wolf began to take on different roles in the field of data science. At first, he worked as a data analyst, using his sharp mind to uncover patterns and trends in large datasets. Then, he moved on to become a machine learning engineer, developing algorithms that could learn and adapt on their own.\nAs his skills grew, John the Wolf began to take on even more advanced roles. He became a data architect, designing complex systems that could store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data. He also worked as a data scientist in a research lab, developing new techniques and methods to push the boundaries of what was possible in the field.\nThrough all of this, John the Wolf never forgot his roots. He always remained true to his wolfish nature, using his instincts and cunning to stay ahead of the curve. And yet, he also embraced his human side, using his intelligence and creativity to solve complex problems and make a real difference in the world.\nIn the end, John the Wolf found that his transformation into a data scientist had been a truly transformative experience. He had learned to think critically, to work with others, and to push himself to new heights. And in doing so, he had become not just a data scientist, but a true leader in his field.\nJohn the Wolf has 13 letters!"

I examined the reasons why contestants were either medically evacuated or left for medical health or personal family reasons, and checked if there was any significant difference in the arrival rate between males and females. I did find that the is a 50% chance that gender females last longer then males (approx. 60 days) due to family or personal reason. I found this insightful and full of potential discussions. Please comment bellow to discuss more in detail.\nFurthermore, I decided to investigate the professions of the participants and see if there were any significant differences in the survival rate among different professions. I categorized the professions into white-collar, outdoor survivalists, blue-collar tradesmen, armed forces, and others, mostly entrepreneurs. I found that outdoor survivalists and blue-collar tradesmen were more likely to survive longer than armed forces and white-collar workers. This was an interesting finding as it confirmed some assumptions that people might have about survival skills, and it was exciting to have an analysis that could prove these assumptions.\nDuring this data exploration, I was aware of the potential biases that could arise from categorizing the professions, so I tried to make sure that I did it in the most ethical way possible. When there were things that I didn’t know, I put them into the “Other” category to avoid any unintentional biases. Overall, this project provided a great opportunity for me to use my data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills, and I learned a lot from this experience."

    "text": "Once upon a time, in a deep forest, there was a powerful and cunning wolf. His name was John the Wolf and was unlike any other, for he was able to transform into a human at will.\nOne day, as he was wandering through the woods, John the Wolf stumbled upon a group of humans. Intrigued by their ways, he decided to observe them from afar. The humans were busy with their daily activities, and among them, there was a group of people who caught the wolf’s attention. They were working with numbers, graphs, and statistics. The wolf had never seen anything like it before.\nCurious, John the Wolf approached the humans and asked them what they were doing. They explained that they were data scientists, and they were using data to solve problems and make informed decisions.\nThe John the Wolf was fascinated. He decided that he wanted to become a data scientist too. And so, he began to study. He spent hours poring over books and practicing his skills. He learned how to collect and analyze data, how to create algorithms and models, and how to use visualizations to communicate his findings.\nAs he grew more proficient, John the Wolf began to take on different roles in the field of data science. At first, he worked as a data analyst, using his sharp mind to uncover patterns and trends in large datasets. Then, he moved on to become a machine learning engineer, developing algorithms that could learn and adapt on their own.\nAs his skills grew, John the Wolf began to take on even more advanced roles. He became a data architect, designing complex systems that could store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data. He also worked as a data scientist in a research lab, developing new techniques and methods to push the boundaries of what was possible in the field.\nThrough all of this, John the Wolf never forgot his roots. He always remained true to his wolfish nature, using his instincts and cunning to stay ahead of the curve. And yet, he also embraced his human side, using his intelligence and creativity to solve complex problems and make a real difference in the world.\nIn the end, John the Wolf found that his transformation into a data scientist had been a truly transformative experience. He had learned to think critically, to work with others, and to push himself to new heights. And in doing so, he had become not just a data scientist, but a true leader in his field.\nJohn the Wolf has 13 letters!"
