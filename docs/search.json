    "text": "Conclusion\nAfter exploring the Alone Tidy Tuesday data set, I conducted an analysis to determine the survival rate of male and female participants. I examined the reasons why contestants were either medically evacuated or left for medical health or personal family reasons, and checked if there was any significant difference in the arrival rate between males and females. I did find that the is a 50% chance that gender females last longer then males (approx. 60 days) due to family or personal reason. I found this insightful and full of potential discussions. Please comment bellow to discuss more in detail.\nFurthermore, I decided to investigate the professions of the participants and see if there were any significant differences in the survival rate among different professions. I categorized the professions into white-collar, outdoor survivalists, blue-collar tradesmen, armed forces, and others, mostly entrepreneurs. I found that outdoor survivalists and blue-collar tradesmen were more likely to survive longer than armed forces and white-collar workers. This was an interesting finding as it confirmed some assumptions that people might have about survival skills, and it was exciting to have an analysis that could prove these assumptions.\nDuring this data exploration, I was aware of the potential biases that could arise from categorizing the professions, so I tried to make sure that I did it in the most ethical way possible. When there were things that I didn’t know, I put them into the “Other” category to avoid any unintentional biases. Overall, this project provided a great opportunity for me to use my data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills, and I learned a lot from this experience."
