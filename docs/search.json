    "text": "What is Tidy Tuesday?\nTidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in the R programming language community, created by R for Data Science authors Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick. The project involves posting a new dataset on the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repository every Tuesday, along with a set of questions or challenges related to the data. The aim of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a fun and collaborative way for R users to improve their data analysis and visualization skills, and to share their work with the broader community.\n\n\nWhat data I decided to use for one of the Tidy Tuesday?\nIn a Tidy Tuesday project, the Alone data set was provided, which contains information about the participants and their progress in the Alone TV series. The data set includes 8 seasons of the show, with each season consisting of a different set of contestants who are dropped off in a remote wilderness location and must survive alone. The data set includes information such as the contestant’s name, age, gender, occupation, location, survival equipment, and duration of their stay. The project provided a valuable opportunity for me to practice their data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills using real-world data in a fun and engaging way.\n\n\nOn Average Days Lasted\n39 days is the average days lasted on the show alone\n\n\nCheck out the Code!\n#survivalists%>% \n#summarise(num_patients = n(),)\n\n#table(survivalists$gender)\n#table(survivalists$age)\nagegen<- lm(days_lasted~gender ,survivalists)\n#summary(agegen)\n\nalone<- survivalists%>%\n  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender ==\"Female\",1,0))\n\ngen_avg<-survivalists%>%\n  select(gender, days_lasted)%>%\n  group_by(gender)%>%\n  summarise(med_last = median(days_lasted))\n  \n#gen_avg\n\n  ggplot(gen_avg,aes(gender,med_last,fill=gender))+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n    ylab(\"Median of days someone last\")+\n  labs(\n        title=\"The difference in  of females vs. males\",\n        subtitle = \"How many days they lasted in the show Alone\",\n        x=\" male and females lasted in days\")"
