It is a three-hectare site filled with huge stone structures containing spectacular finds. The site is important because the rich artifacts found within the buildings and the location of the site between the two stone circles indicate that the Ness of Brodgar was very significant culturally and religiously to the Neolithic people of Orkney."

    "text": "Once upon a time, in a deep forest, there was a powerful and cunning wolf. His name was John the Wolf and was unlike any other, for he was able to transform into a human at will.\nOne day, as he was wandering through the woods, John the Wolf stumbled upon a group of humans. Intrigued by their ways, he decided to observe them from afar. The humans were busy with their daily activities, and among them, there was a group of people who caught the wolf’s attention. They were working with numbers, graphs, and statistics. The wolf had never seen anything like it before.\nCurious, John the Wolf approached the humans and asked them what they were doing. They explained that they were data scientists, and they were using data to solve problems and make informed decisions.\nThe John the Wolf was fascinated. He decided that he wanted to become a data scientist too. And so, he began to study. He spent hours poring over books and practicing his skills. He learned how to collect and analyze data, how to create algorithms and models, and how to use visualizations to communicate his findings.\nAs he grew more proficient, John the Wolf began to take on different roles in the field of data science. At first, he worked as a data analyst, using his sharp mind to uncover patterns and trends in large datasets. Then, he moved on to become a machine learning engineer, developing algorithms that could learn and adapt on their own.\nAs his skills grew, John the Wolf began to take on even more advanced roles. He became a data architect, designing complex systems that could store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data. He also worked as a data scientist in a research lab, developing new techniques and methods to push the boundaries of what was possible in the field.\nThrough all of this, John the Wolf never forgot his roots. He always remained true to his wolfish nature, using his instincts and cunning to stay ahead of the curve. And yet, he also embraced his human side, using his intelligence and creativity to solve complex problems and make a real difference in the world.\nIn the end, John the Wolf found that his transformation into a data scientist had been a truly transformative experience. He had learned to think critically, to work with others, and to push himself to new heights. And in doing so, he had become not just a data scientist, but a true leader in his field.\nJohn the Wolf has 13 letters!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nAfter diving into the Alone Tidy Tuesday data set, I conducted an analysis to examine the survival rate of men and women participants. I specifically looked at the reasons behind contestants being medically evacuated or leaving for medical health or personal family reasons, and investigated if there were any significant differences in survival rates between genders. Interestingly, I found that there was a 50% higher chance for female participants to outlast males (approximately 60 days longer) due to family or personal reasons. This finding sparked my curiosity and I believe it opens up potential discussions. I encourage you to share your thoughts below so that we can delve into more detailed analysis.\nAdditionally, I decided to explore the professions of the participants and investigate if there were any notable disparities in survival rates among different occupational categories. I classified the professions into white-collar workers, outdoor survivalists, blue-collar tradesmen, armed forces, and others, predominantly entrepreneurs. The analysis revealed that outdoor survivalists and blue-collar tradesmen had a higher likelihood of surviving longer compared to armed forces and white-collar workers. This finding was fascinating as it validated certain assumptions about survival skills, and I was thrilled to have data-backed evidence supporting these assumptions.\nThroughout this data exploration, I was mindful of potential biases that could arise from categorizing the professions. I made a conscious effort to ensure ethical considerations by placing unknowns into the “Other” category to prevent unintentional biases. Overall, this project provided an excellent opportunity for me to apply my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. I gained valuable insights from this experience and expanded my knowledge in the process."

    "text": "Once upon a time, in a deep forest, there was a powerful and cunning wolf. His name was John the Wolf and was unlike any other, for he was able to transform into a human at will.\nOne day, as he was wandering through the woods, John the Wolf stumbled upon a group of humans. Intrigued by their ways, he decided to observe them from afar. The humans were busy with their daily activities, and among them, there was a group of people who caught the wolf’s attention. They were working with numbers, graphs, and statistics. The wolf had never seen anything like it before.\nCurious, John the Wolf approached the humans and asked them what they were doing. They explained that they were data scientists, and they were using data to solve problems and make informed decisions.\nThe John the Wolf was fascinated. He decided that he wanted to become a data scientist too. And so, he began to study. He spent hours poring over books and practicing his skills. He learned how to collect and analyze data, how to create algorithms and models, and how to use visualizations to communicate his findings.\nAs he grew more proficient, John the Wolf began to take on different roles in the field of data science. At first, he worked as a data analyst, using his sharp mind to uncover patterns and trends in large datasets. Then, he moved on to become a machine learning engineer, developing algorithms that could learn and adapt on their own.\nAs his skills grew, John the Wolf began to take on even more advanced roles. He became a data architect, designing complex systems that could store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data. He also worked as a data scientist in a research lab, developing new techniques and methods to push the boundaries of what was possible in the field.\nThrough all of this, John the Wolf never forgot his roots. He always remained true to his wolfish nature, using his instincts and cunning to stay ahead of the curve. And yet, he also embraced his human side, using his intelligence and creativity to solve complex problems and make a real difference in the world.\nIn the end, John the Wolf found that his transformation into a data scientist had been a truly transformative experience. He had learned to think critically, to work with others, and to push himself to new heights. And in doing so, he had become not just a data scientist, but a true leader in his field.\nJohn the Wolf has 13 letters!"

It became evident that men in these situations had a lower chance of survival compared to women. This finding suggests that leaving for personal or family reasons might have different impacts on survival for men and women. To gain a deeper understanding of why this difference exists, further research is needed.\n\n\nCode\nalone3 = alone%>%\n    mutate(status = ifelse(reason_category == \"Family / personal\",1,0))\n\nal3 = alone3 %>%\n    mutate(left=days_lasted,right=ifelse(status==1,days_lasted,NA))\n\n\nsurvObject3=Surv(al3$left,al3$right,type=\"interval2\")\n\nkm3=survfit(survObject3~al3$gender) # over all, give table. \n#summary(km3)\n\nmod3<-ggsurvplot(fit=km3, data=al3,risk.table = F,conf.int=F,surv.median.line = \"hv\",\nlegend=\"right\",legend.title = \"Gender\",legend.labs = c(\"female\",\"male\"),ggtheme = theme_minimal())+ labs(\n        title=\"Survival time until survivalist left for Family or personal reasons\",\n        x=\"Days in which survivalist lasted in days\"\n    )\n \n\nmod3\n\n\n\n\n\nfig. 4: Survival rate of gender and reason for leaving: family or personal"

    "text": "Data science encompasses diverse information and data-related disciplines, offering multiple perspectives on its nature and scope. While interpretations of data science may vary, there are certain considerations to bear in mind when developing your viewpoint and utilizing data science tools.\nIn today’s world, it is essential to recognize the empowering potential of data science. By providing information, it enables us to perceive, construct, and analyze data, leading to better decision-making for the future. Moreover, data science facilitates the availability of data for further research, which can contribute to the development of improved systems and deepen our understanding of society and the global world.\nData science is commonly perceived as a multidomain field, including finance, marketing, business, HR, government, and more. Its purpose is to utilize data to extract insights and knowledge that can address problems and guide decision-making. This involves organizing and analyzing data to derive valuable information and draw meaningful conclusions. Ultimately, data science aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within data to generate predictions and enhance decision-making processes.\nI would like to see data science take a step further by using data science as a system to recognizing and addressing the gaps in technological accuracy within our world and where our biases come from. By Allocating time and resources to disciplines like earth sciences, social sciences, and other disciplines can foster a more equitable cultural knowledge and transparency. It is important to recognize the vast potential and positive impact that data science bring to our world. By embracing these tools and disciplines, we can drive positive change, empower individuals and communities, and create a future that is more informed, inclusive, and prosperous for all in the exponential growth of technological advancements.\nI am looking forward to connecting with like mind folx to have a deeper understand and practical applications into regards of the direction of information technology is heading!\n** Disclaimer that these word and context can change as I continue to learn and grow. Looking for thoughts and conversations around these topics. **"

It is a three-hectare site filled with huge stone structures containing spectacular finds. The site is important because the rich artifacts found within the buildings and the location of the site between the two stone circles indicate that the Ness of Brodgar was very significant culturally and religiously to the Neolithic people of Orkney."
